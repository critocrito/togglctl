# `togglctl`

A command line client for the [Toggl Track](https://www.toggl.com/track/) API. The goal is to list, start and stop time tracking entries and make this functionality available to Alfred and Keyboard Maestro. The Toggl Github page has documentation for the [HTTP API](https://github.com/toggl/toggl_api_docs).
